For us, that meant scrapping our original big wedding plans and downsizing everything to a small-scale event where the guestlist was reduced to just the bare minimum. Though there were many challenges, one of our biggest problems was trying to a reasonable livestreaming option to share our special day with everyone who couldn\u2019t be there (so basically most of our guestlist). However, we were shocked to find that most available livestreaming services were overpriced, offering too much without really covering the essentials, or simply did not fit what we were looking for. So, what did we do? We livestreamed our own wedding! We did the research, invested in the equipment, and repeatedly tested until we were pleased with the quality. We have since livestreamed several other events, including weddings, receptions, funerals, and more. With each event, we have learned a lot about working with different spaces and situations. Now, we are confident that we can help others by offering a quality livestreaming service that is straightforward, accommodating, and price conscious."})]}),(0,r.jsxs)(b,{children:[(0,r.jsx)(x,{children:"Our Mission"}),(0,r.jsx)(j,{children:"To make quality livestreaming services more accessible by making them as simple and flexible as possible."})]}),(0,r.jsxs)(b,{children:[(0,r.jsx)(x,{children:"Our Values"}),(0,r.jsx)(j,{children:"Integrity \u2013 We aim to be as straightforward and honest as possible."}),(0,r.jsx)(j,{children:"Quality \u2013 Our goal is to produce the highest quality livestream using industry-backed equipment."}),(0,r.jsx)(j,{children:"Reasonable \u2013 All of services are affordable and flexible to suit the needs of the event."})]}),(0,r.jsxs)(b,{children:[(0,r.jsx)(x,{children:"Our Commitment"}),(0,r.jsx)(j,{children:"You\u2019ll see our commitment to integrity when you see our service packages, where each package is broken down for you to understand what is and isn\u2019t included.
